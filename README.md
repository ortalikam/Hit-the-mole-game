# Hit-the-mole-game

When the user reaches the game page he will be asked
Choose a game level from 3 options:
Easy, medium, hard.
Then click the Start Game button.

Depending on the user's choice, a board with several cells should be constructed according to the level:
Easy level - 3X3 board
Medium Level - 5X5 Table
Hard Level - Table of 10X10

The mole will pop up randomly in each cell and stay there for a random period of time ranging from 1 second to 1.5 seconds.
 When it disappears from the cell it will rise in the next cell after a transfer time of 0.25 seconds per second (randomly).

The user should be presented with the amount of his successes (clicking on the mole) and the amount of his disqualifications (failure).
After 3 disqualifications the user will receive a game over notification and he will have to select a level again and start the game again.
